# bookshop-react-typescript

Bookshop is an imaginary online bookshop, for the [bookshop-spring](https://github.com/b-yousefi/bookshop-spring) API, with the following features:
- displaying books, with pagination 
- display book information with links to its authors, and categories
- filtering books based on author, category and publication
- displaying authors with the ability to filter
- displaying author information including his/her books
- displaying categories with their subcategories and the books in that category 
- registering user
- adding books to the shopping cart
- completing the order by choosing the address that is going to be sent to
- displaying user information, its profile, addresses, and orders
- adding address, marking a place on map

It is similar to the [bookshop-react](https://github.com/b-yousefi/bookshop-react) web application; however instead of JavaScript it is written with TypeScript. In addition, some refactoring has been done to make the code cleaner!
